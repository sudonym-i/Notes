# Trading Strategies: Entry/Exit Points, Beta, and Support/Resistance

## Entry and Exit Points

### Entry Point Strategies
1. **Momentum Entry**
   - Enter when price breaks above resistance
   - Confirm with volume and technical indicators
   - $Entry Point = Breakout Price + Confirmation Threshold$

2. **Pullback Entry**
   - Wait for price retracement in trending market
   - Enter near support levels
   - $Entry = Trend Line + Percentage Pullback$

### Exit Point Strategies
1. **Stop Loss**
   - Predetermined price to limit potential losses
   - Calculated methods:
     - Percentage-based: $Stop Loss = Entry Price * (1 - Risk Percentage)$
     - Technical: Below support levels

2. **Take Profit**
   - Predetermined price to secure gains
   - Methods:
     - Fixed percentage: $Take Profit = Entry Price * (1 + Profit Percentage)$
     - Resistance level targets

## Beta Analysis

### Beta Calculation
$Beta = \frac{Covariance(Asset Returns, Market Returns)}{Variance(Market Returns)}$

### Beta Interpretation
- **β < 1**: Less volatile than market
- **β = 1**: Moves with market
- **β > 1**: More volatile than market

### Beta Risk Categories
| Beta Range' | Risk Profile' | Market Behavior' |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 0 - 0.5    | Low Risk     | Defensive       |
| 0.5 - 1.0  | Moderate     | Stable          |
| 1.0 - 1.5  | Market Correlated | Neutral     |
| > 1.5      | High Risk    | Aggressive      |

## Support and Resistance

### Support Level
- Price level where buying interest prevents further decline
- Calculated methods:
  - Historical price clustering
  - Moving average intersections
  - $Support = Lowest Historical Price + Buffer$

### Resistance Level
- Price level where selling pressure prevents further rise
- Calculation techniques:
  - Previous price peaks
  - Fibonacci retracement
  - $Resistance = Highest Historical Price - Buffer$

### Breakout Confirmation
- Volume increase
- Sustained price movement
- $Breakout Strength = \frac{Price Movement}{Average Volume}$

## Strategic Considerations
- No single method guarantees success
- Combine multiple analysis techniques
- Continuous learning and adaptation

## Tools and Indicators
- Moving Averages
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- MACD
- Bollinger Bands
