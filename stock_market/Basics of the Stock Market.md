# Stock Market Summary & Explanations

## Why Businesses Issue Stock/Shares
Businesses issue stock to raise capital without taking on debt. When shares are sold, the company receives funds from investors, who in return gain ownership rights and a stake in future profits. This helps companies grow, expand, or fund operations.

## Debt vs Equity
- **Debt:** Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Creditors have no ownership but are paid before shareholders if the company liquidates.
- **Equity:** Ownership in the company (via shares). Equity holders may receive dividends and benefit from company growth, but their returns are not guaranteed.

## What is a Market?
A market is any system or place (physical or digital) where buyers and sellers exchange goods, services, or financial assets.

### Primary Market
Where companies issue new securities (stocks, bonds) directly to investors, such as in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs).

### Secondary Market
Where existing securities are traded between investors after they have been issued in the primary market. Examples: NYSE, NASDAQ.

## What is a Stock Market?
A stock market is a secondary market dedicated to the buying and selling of shares of publicly listed companies.
