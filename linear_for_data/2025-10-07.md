## Definition
A matrix **U** is **unitary** if:
$$U^*U = UU^* = I$$

where $U^*$ is the conjugate transpose (Hermitian transpose) of $U$, and $I$ is the identity matrix.

For real matrices, unitary matrices are called **orthogonal matrices**, where $U^T U = I$.

## Key Properties

### 1. Inverse Relationship
$$U^{-1} = U^*$$
The inverse of a unitary matrix equals its conjugate transpose.

### 2. Preservation of Inner Products
For vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}$:
$$\langle U\mathbf{x}, U\mathbf{y} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \rangle$$
Unitary matrices preserve inner products, making them isometries.

### 3. Preservation of Norms
$$\|U\mathbf{x}\| = \|\mathbf{x}\|$$
Unitary transformations preserve vector lengths (norms).

### 4. Determinant Property
$$|\det(U)| = 1$$
The absolute value of the determinant of a unitary matrix is always 1.

### 5. Eigenvalue Property
All eigenvalues $\lambda$ of a unitary matrix satisfy:
$$|\lambda| = 1$$
Eigenvalues lie on the unit circle in the complex plane.

### 6. Column and Row Orthonormality
- The columns of $U$ form an orthonormal set
- The rows of $U$ form an orthonormal set

### 7. Closure Under Composition
The product of two unitary matrices is unitary:
$$\text{If } U_1, U_2 \text{ are unitary, then } U_1U_2 \text{ is unitary}$$

### 8. Diagonalization
Every unitary matrix is **normal** ($UU^* = U^*U$) and can be diagonalized by a unitary similarity transformation:
$$U = VDV^*$$
where $V$ is unitary and $D$ is diagonal with eigenvalues on the diagonal.

## Examples

### Rotation Matrix (2D)
$$R(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix}$$

### Identity Matrix
$$I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

### Reflection Matrix
$$H = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

### Complex Unitary Matrix
$$U = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & i \\ i & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

## Applications

1. **Quantum Mechanics**: Quantum gates are represented by unitary matrices
2. **Signal Processing**: Fourier transforms and wavelet transforms
3. **Numerical Stability**: QR decomposition uses orthogonal/unitary matrices
4. **Computer Graphics**: Rotations and reflections preserve shapes
5. **Data Compression**: Orthogonal transforms for efficient encoding
